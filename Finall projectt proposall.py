# WINTER IS COMING!
# A Game of Thrones is the first novel in A Song of Ice and Fire, a series of fantasy novels by American author George R. R. Martin. There's currently five! main Game of Thrones books out right now, and two more are on the way. Plus, there's a prequel book, which is what House of Dragon is based on.
# I will analyze the network of characters in the GAME OF THRONES books. Here, two characters are considered to have appeared together if their names appear around 15 words from each other in the books.
